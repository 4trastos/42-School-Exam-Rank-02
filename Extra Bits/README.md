Bit operators:

*** This is intended to be an aid in learning to operate with bits. ***

*** Here you can operate and demonstrate the functions that are asked of you in Exam 02 about operating with bits. ***

Bit operators can only operate on char and int data types (decimal, hexadecimal, and octal integers). Bit operators perform operations on each of the bits of an integer or char.
These operators are:

• AND, represented by the & symbol.
• OR, represented by the symbol I.
• XOR, represented by the symbol A.
• One's complement, represented by the symbol ~.
• Shift to the left, is represented by two minor signs
that (").
• Shift to the right, it is represented by two major signs
that (").
